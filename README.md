# AI Lab

This repository is a personal lab for experimenting with and learning about AI, LLMs, and related technologies like LangChain. It serves as a collection of code snippets, experiments, and small projects.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run a specific file:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init`. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Useful Resources

- [LangGraph.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs): A framework for building resilient language agents as graphs. It is the JavaScript/TypeScript version of the original Python LangGraph.
